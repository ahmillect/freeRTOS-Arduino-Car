# freeRTOS-Arduino-Car
Modern day vehicles come with various safety and entertainment features to make our lives better. In this project, we implemented these features using two ARDUINO MEGA Boards setting a suitable priority to each feature. We also developed this project using Arduino C alongside FreeRTOS.
Our projectâ€™s main aim is to keep our car in its own lane and the car, of course, will prioritize staying in its own lane. For a variation of the safety components that we afforded and developed into the car. Firstly, front headlights that serve as the eyes of the car on the road. Secondly, a control indicator that shows the gear the car currently uses. There is no neglection to the entertainment features in the car, it offers the possibility to listen to the radio and choose between specific available radio stations.
